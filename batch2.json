      "b": "-3",
      "c": "1.75",
      "d": "-1.75"
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The formula is (Target - Actual) / Target, but expressed as a ratio. Here, (4% - 7%) / 4% = -0.75. Multiplying the percentage variance by the original target doesn't yield a standard metric. The question likely refers to the percentage point difference (7%-4%=3%) divided by the target (3/4=0.75) and then inverting it because it is underperformance, leading to a non-standard calculation. However, if calculated as (Actual-Target)/Target = (7-4)/4 = 0.75, showing a 75% miss. If expressed as a multiplier of the target miss, 7/4 = 1.75, which is -0.75 performance against target. The intended answer seems to be a non-standard calculation of (7/4) representing how much worse the actual was than the target."
